# 02 Operating System

This section was meant for understanding and probably installing an operating system. I might need to come back to this part, as I have worked with Windows, MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu/Debian). And I may need to use a VM to work through the tutorials and lessons associated with it.

Since that is the case, we'll just understand what are operating systems. Taking a snippet from the Roadmaps info.
An Operating System is an interface between user and computer hardware. An OS allows software programmes to communicate with a computer's hardware. 
There is usually confusion around what is a `kernel`, which is the name of a piece of software that houses the fundamental elements of an Operating System.
