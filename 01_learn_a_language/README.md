# 01 Learn a Programming Language

Usually in a case like this, the approach is to follow the advice of the experienced people who have done this before, but I want to maximize my learning and also get as low-level as possible in whatever I learn, I want to learn how the code I write affects the hardware and that also includes the memory and what is included.

The language I have chosen to learn and focus on is the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/). It is a fairly young language, but I love the idea of nothing being hidden, and having to be concious of memory and dealing where the bytes are.

This section of the repository, will be where I track the individual learnings related to Zig that do not fall within their own sections.
