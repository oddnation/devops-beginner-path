# DevOps Beginner Path

This is my way of learning DevOps using the roadmap from the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops?r=devops) which details a beginner learning path for the budding DevOps, SRE or any other Operations Role.

This repo will contain documentation and a few projects that touch on DevOps, as my main focus will be more inline with git branching strategies and how to improve both the documentation and CICD pipelines.

I take no credit in this roadmap, it was downloaded from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/get-started) , please head over to their website as they have great roadmaps for a lot of roles within the software development space along with resources attached.
